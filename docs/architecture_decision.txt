Conection, Person and Front-end microservice:
	I use API Restful with protocol HTTP because it does not running streaming data. So I think Rest API is the better solution than gRPC

Location microservice:
	I use gRPC because it might get a large data. gRPC does running streaming data. So, gRPC is the best solution for location microservice.
